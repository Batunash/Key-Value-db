----Memory vs Disk trade offs----
Memory(ram): Extremly fast acces but it is volatile, lose all data when power off. Limited capacity and expensive.
Disk(ssd/hdd): Slow persisten and has huge capacity also cheap but durable and acces latenct.
Our goal is making slow and persistent storage(disk)feel like fast and volatile.
---Buffer managemnt---
Db uses buffer pools or caches to hold frequently accesed data in memory. when a query request a data:
1) check if it is already in memory ,(buffer pool) fast
2) if not, load it from disk into buffer pool slow.
Eviction polices:
lru (least recently used)mru,clock algorithms etc. decide what data to evict when memory is full.
---Page based storage---
db divide data into fixed-size pages generally 4kb 8kb 16lb.. up to 64 kb per page.
Efficient to read/write in chunks due to disk I/O characteristics
Minimizes overhead per disk operation
Simplifies buffer management (entire pages are cached)
The smallest unit transfared between disk and memory often a page.
