-----Command Parsing-----
Before a sql queary can be exec. the database needs to understand and validate it.
--Lexical Analysis--
The raw SQL command is treated as a string of characters.
The Lexical Analyzer (Tokenizer) breaks this string into smaller units called tokens, such as:
SELECT name FROM students WHERE age > 20;
Token Type  | Example
Keyword     | `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE` |
Identifier  | `name`, `students`, `age` |
Operator    | `>`                       |
Literal     | `20`                      |
Punctuation | `;`                       |
Purpose, make the input easier to process for next stages.
--Syntax parsing--
Takes the tokens and tries to build a valid syntactic structure, often a parse tree or abstract syntax tree (AST).
Checks if the command follows the grammar.
Ä°f grammar is incorrect a syntax error is returned immediatly.
--Semantic validation--
Even if command is syntacticly correct,the database Checks logical correctnes like if the table,columns exist.
