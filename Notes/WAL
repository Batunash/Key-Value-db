-----Write Ahead Logging-----
To ensure data changes are permanent even if system crash.
Cant do with ram DÄ±sk I/O is slow so wrting every small chane immediatley to disk isnt practical.
so wal= changes are first written into a sequential log on disk.
after log record is safely persisted the actual data page memory can be modified and eventually flsuhed to disk
The log has what change is ahppening(before and after image)and transaction info.
Log must be writtento disk before corresponding dirty page is written
Recovery process:
Read the WAL log from disk.
Redo committed transactions Reapply changes that were logged but maybe not yet written to the data files.
Undo uncommitted transactions (optional, depending on system).
Checkpointing:Dirty Pages Pages in memory modified but not yet flushed to disk.
Checkpoint is A controlled operation that Flushes all dirty pages to disk.
Writes a checkpoint record to the log, marking a consistent state.
